=========

Non-parametric feature based Bayesian algorithms

v0.1
	-Read gzip, stdin and regular text files
	-Creates a hash entry for every input token
	-Converts the token data to id-data using hash corresponding values

------FUTURE WORK------
	-Memory/CPU time logs might be helpful
	-Read the model paper and prepare the input file accordingly
	-Implement the model
	-Implement the score functions
