induction
=========

Non-parametric feature based Bayesian algorithms

v0.0.2
	-Tok k freature values threshold is added
	-learn.cpp and type.cpp are added
	-Format the data to start learning

v0.0.1
	-Read gzip, stdin and regular text files
	-Creates a hash entry for every input token
	-Converts the token data to id-data using hash corresponding values

------FUTURE WORK------
	-Memory/CPU time logs might be helpful
	-Implement the model
	-Implement the score functions
